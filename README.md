# Nick Durbin's GitHub ðŸš€

## Welcome to My Journey in AI, AGI, and Beyond!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nick Durbin, a university student with a deep passion for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and cutting-edge AI research. My primary goal is to **contribute to the creation of AGI** through research and development.

### ðŸŒ± Current Focus
- **Research in AGI**: Iâ€™m currently exploring the concept of **agentic behavior** and **multi-task learning**, aiming to build a neural network that captures general intelligence. My interests include leveraging the **LLaMA model stack** to simulate adaptive, decision-making agents.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Iâ€™m actively reading and implementing state-of-the-art papers from platforms like **Arxiv**, replicating results and contributing my insights through independent projects.
- **Building My Own Neural Network**: As part of my research, Iâ€™m working on designing my own neural network architectures to better understand the mechanics behind generalization and intelligence in AI.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- **Contribute to AGI Research**: Publish a research paper on AGI-related topics, possibly focusing on agentic behavior, multi-task learning, or AI safety.
- **Develop a Startup Idea**: Long term, I plan to launch a startup aimed at solving pain points for the developer community, particularly in AI model training, efficiency, and scalability.
- **Showcase My Work**: Iâ€™m building a **portfolio** to highlight my projects, research, and experiments to demonstrate my skills and contributions to AGI.

### ðŸ”§ Tech & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, C/C++/C#
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, OpenAI Gym, Unity ML-Agents

### ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Learning
- Advanced Neural Networks
- Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Agent Systems
- AI Safety and Ethics in AGI

### ðŸ“š My Research Interests
- **Agentic Behavior**: Understanding how AI systems can act autonomously and make decisions across varying contexts.
- **Multi-Task Learning**: Exploring how neural networks can efficiently learn and generalize across multiple tasks without retraining.
- **AI Safety & Alignment**: Ensuring AGI systems are aligned with human values and behave predictably.

### ðŸš€ Looking Forward
Iâ€™m constantly pushing the boundaries of what I know and aim to contribute meaningfully to the future of AGI. Stay tuned as I document my journey through research papers, innovative projects, and potentially transformative solutions for the AI world.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me if youâ€™re also passionate about AGI, AI ethics, or are simply curious about my work.
